# Lixpi Constants

Shared runtime contracts for TypeScript services and the browser.

## Storage contracts

`ts/asset-types.ts` defines Asset, Meta, ACL, typed references, edit leases, media/rendition states, Blob rows/references, and rendition job request/response types.

`ts/types.ts` defines Asset-backed canvas nodes, media lineage plans/assignments, conversation stream payloads, Workspace state, Capability catalog/manifests/workflows/runs, and shared UI/runtime contracts. Media prompt segments distinguish fuzzy-matchable text, typed non-media references, and bound media references so Capability labels cannot enter media-identity matching. Each image/video node can retain its own durable media-run progress independently of branch markers, including the selected media model/provider and pending lineage assignment needed before the Asset catalog or final `generatedBy` record is available, and each media-generation operation can point directly to its stable `outputNodeId`. Capability module metadata includes the required description-sheet contract. Every `AiModel` carries `inferenceCapabilities`, which describes temperature support, thinking configuration, system prompts, structured schemas, and accepted input kinds. Image-generation models also carry `imageReferenceCapabilities`, which declares reference budgets, conditioning modes, fidelity behavior, supported controls, output pixel limits, and aspect ratios. Shared media-generation control keys and toggle help text keep synchronized model metadata and the browser matrix aligned for controls such as generated audio, watermarking, output format, and returned last frames. The same file defines the privacy-safe Character fidelity request/response contracts; responses can contain detections and scalar similarity, never embeddings. Canvas media/document nodes use `assetId` only; Object Store keys and rendition URLs are not canvas state.

`ts/media-generation-progress.ts` builds the generic durable image/video operation timeline used when a Capability, Skill, or Tool does not publish its own nested progress items. Progress items distinguish clean completion from an `attention` result that finished but still requires user review; actual execution failures remain `failed`. Its terminal settlement helper recursively closes every still-pending or running descendant for completed, failed, and cancelled runs, including recovery paths that have no prior progress snapshot.

`ts/media-generation-layout-settings.ts` owns the API/WebUI branch-layout and collision metrics. Preflight branch markers use the normal canvas-world marker dimensions and `nodeGap`; there is no separate composer-relative stack or handoff animation timing. Resolved media collision envelopes reserve the title above the pixels and the action/model strip below them at the bounded zoom curve's maximum world-space footprint; compact pre-frame circles intentionally reserve neither strip until the first frame resolves.

Capability data contracts remain in `ts/types.ts`. Manifest, workflow, resource, and dependency-graph validation lives in [`@lixpi/capability-system`](../capability-system/README.md), because validation is executable Capability behavior rather than a constant.

`ts/aws-resources.ts` contains only active DynamoDB resource names, including the six revision-2 tables. `nats-subjects.json` contains active Asset/Blob processing and maintenance subjects, Capability subjects, and the internal Character panel fidelity subject.

Nothing here prices anything. Rates, usage reports, the metering check/confirm contract, and the money constants live in [`@lixpi/usage-reporter`](../usage-reporter/README.md); `nats-subjects.json` still carries the `METRICS_SUBJECTS` that contract travels on, because every subject in the system is listed there. An `AiModel` from this package therefore has no `pricing` field, which is what makes it safe to hand straight to the browser.

## TypeScript usage

```ts
import {
  NATS_SUBJECTS,
  STREAM_STATUS,
  type Asset,
  type CanvasNode,
  type GenerateRenditionsRequest,
} from '@lixpi/constants'

const createAssetSubject = NATS_SUBJECTS.ASSET_SUBJECTS.CREATE
const renditionSubject = NATS_SUBJECTS.BLOB_PROCESSING_SUBJECTS.GENERATE_RENDITIONS
```

Edit `nats-subjects.json` once; TypeScript wrappers consume it directly. The preserved Python wrapper is for non-runtime legacy tooling and future service splits, not an alternate active storage contract.
